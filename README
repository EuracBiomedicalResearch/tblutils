Notes
-----

tbl2excel was adapted from gm_snp2x/gm_txt2gmo. It uses the Perl helper
"tbl2excel-helper" internally for the libspreadsheet-writeexcel-perl module.

This is *not* ideal, but:

* there seems to be no library to write Excel files directly in C/C++,
* a Perl script was too slow for the reading/detection process.

The gm_txt2gmo auto-detection mechanism was already excellent, and was
simplified to ignore column lengths.
